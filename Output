Running the Code (Code Implementation Procedure)

To run the program and obtain the outputs, you will need two files:

ebay-delivery-date-prediction.py
dataset.csv

Commands to Run the Program Files
There are two ways to run the files to get the output:

1. In an Online Python Compiler:

   1. Open an Online Python Compiler: Use an online Python compiler that has the `scikit-learn` library installed/available.
   2. Create Python File: Create a Python file named `ebay-delivery-date-prediction.py` and copy-paste the code from the file mentioned in the GitHub repository.
   3. Create Data File: Create another file named `dataset.csv` and copy-paste the data from the file mentioned in the GitHub repository.
   4. Run the Python File: Execute the `ebay-delivery-date-prediction.py` file in the online compiler. The script will automatically process data from `dataset.csv` and provide the output.

2.  In the Command Prompt/Terminal:

  1. Navigate to the Directory: Open a terminal or command prompt.
  2. Change Directory: Navigate to the directory where your files are located. For example, if they are on your desktop (on Windows):
      
                                                                cd Desktop
Replace `Desktop` with the actual path to your directory if it's located elsewhere.

3. Run the Python Script: Use the `python` command followed by the name of your Python script file:

                                               python ebay-delivery-date-prediction.py

Expected Output:

The script will attempt to load dataset.csv from the same directory. It will process the data, perform machine learning tasks (as per the script), and print outputs such as Mean Absolute Error and Predicted Delivery Date 
based on the model's predictions.

Example Output

Mean Absolute Error: 0.28
Predicted Delivery Date: 1.72 days

Troubleshooting Steps:

Ensure Correct Data Types: Verify all values in `dataset.csv` are numeric and there are no missing values.
Check File Path: Make sure the script and the dataset are in the same directory, or provide the correct file path to 
`pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')`.
Remove Non-Numeric Values: Ensure there are no non-numeric values or headers beyond the first row.
