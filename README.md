# eBay-ML-Competition
# Project Overview
Built a model using python and machine learning techniques that can accurately predict delivery dates for items sold on eBay, handling the factors like time taken by the seller to package and transit time, with an accuracy of 72%. Used a training data set of 15 million records and test data of 2.5 million records.

Summary of the Outputs:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.28: This indicates the average absolute difference between the predicted delivery dates and the actual delivery dates in the test set. A lower MAE is generally better, and 0.28 suggests that the model is reasonably accurate given the small sample size of the dataset.

Predicted Delivery Date: 1.72 days: This is the predicted delivery date for the new data provided in the script (seller_packaging_time of 2.5 days and transit_time of 1.8 days). It shows that the model is able to generate predictions based on the input features.
