# eBay-ML-Competition
# Project Overview
In this project, I built a machine learning model using Python to accurately predict the delivery dates for items sold on eBay. The goal was to handle various factors such as the time taken by the seller to package the item and the transit time, achieving an accuracy of 72%. The dataset used consisted of 15 million records for training and 2.5 million records for testing.

# Objectives
1. Develop a machine learning model to estimate delivery dates for eBay items.
2. Handle factors influencing delivery time, including packaging time and transit duration.
3. Achieve high accuracy in predictions to enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
