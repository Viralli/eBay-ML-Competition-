# eBay ML Competition: Delivery Date Prediction

# Project Overview
In this project, I built a machine learning model using Python to accurately predict the delivery dates for items sold on eBay. The goal was to handle various factors such as the time taken by the seller to package the item 
and the transit time, achieving an accuracy of 72%. The dataset used consisted of 15 million records for training and 2.5 million records for testing.

# Objectives
1. Develop a machine learning model to estimate delivery dates for eBay items.
2. Handle factors influencing delivery time, including packaging time and transit duration.
3. Achieve high accuracy in predictions to enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

# Steps and Techniques
1. Data Collection
Source: A large dataset related to eBay deliveries, consisting of historical data on shipment and delivery times.
Training Data: 15 million records
Testing Data: 2.5 million records

2. Data Preprocessing
Data Cleaning:
Removed duplicates and irrelevant data.
Handled missing values using appropriate imputation techniques.

Imputation Techniques:

Mean Imputation: Used for numerical features where missing values were replaced with the mean of the column. The numerical features included:

Seller Packaging Time: The time taken by the seller to package the item.
Transit Time: The time taken for the item to be delivered after being shipped.
Item Weight: The weight of the item being shipped.
Shipping Distance: The distance between the seller's location and the buyer's location.
Median Imputation: Applied for skewed numerical data where missing values were replaced with the median of the column.

Mode Imputation: Used for categorical features where missing values were replaced with the most frequent value (mode) of the column. The categorical features included:

Item Type: The category of the item being sold (e.g., electronics, clothing, books).
Shipping Method: The method of shipping used (e.g., standard, expedited, same-day).
Seller Location: The location of the seller (e.g., city, state, country).
Buyer Location: The location of the buyer (e.g., city, state, country).

Feature Engineering:

Extracted relevant features such as seller packaging time, transit time, item type, shipping method, and historical delivery times.
Created new features to capture interactions between existing features. The new features included:
Seller Packaging Time * Shipping Distance: Interaction between the time taken by the seller to package the item and the distance to be shipped.
Transit Time / Item Weight: Interaction between the transit time and the weight of the item, which can affect delivery time.
Item Type * Shipping Method: Interaction between the type of item and the shipping method used, as different item types may be handled differently depending on the shipping method.
Seller Location * Buyer Location: Interaction between the seller's and buyer's locations to capture regional variations in delivery times.
Historical Average Delivery Time for Item Type: The average delivery time for each item type based on historical data, which can provide a baseline for predictions.
