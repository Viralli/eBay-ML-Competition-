eBay ML Competition

Overview
  Developed a machine learning model in Python to predict delivery dates for items sold on eBay. The model addresses factors such as seller packaging time and transit duration, achieving an accuracy of 72%. 
  It leverages a dataset of 15 million training records and 2.5 million test records.

Key Features
  Delivery Date Prediction: Predicts the estimated delivery date based on seller processing and shipping times.

  Machine Learning Techniques: Utilizes Python libraries (such as pandas, scikit-learn) and machine learning algorithms (Random Forest Regressor) for model training and prediction.

  Accuracy: Achieved 72% accuracy in delivery date predictions, validated against a large-scale dataset.

    Large-scale dataset refers to the extensive amount of data used for training and testing the machine learning model. Specifically, the Large-scale dataset in this project:
      Training Dataset: Consists of 15 million records.
      Test Dataset: Comprises 2.5 million records.

  Scalability: Designed for scalability to handle large volumes of eBay transaction data. The eBay transaction data includes:
    Item Details: Information about the items listed for sale, such as category, description, price, and seller information.
    Transaction History: Records of transactions, including timestamps, buyer and seller IDs, payment details, and shipping information.
    Seller Metrics: Metrics related to sellers' performance, such as seller rating, shipping speed, and customer feedback.
    Shipping and Delivery Information: Details regarding shipping methods, transit times, and delivery dates.
    Marketplace Trends: Insights into market demand, pricing trends, and seasonal fluctuations.

Libraries and Algorithms Used
  Python Libraries: pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for machine learning tasks.
  Machine Learning Algorithm: RandomForestRegressor from scikit-learn for training the delivery date prediction model.

Future Enhancements
  Feature Engineering: Explore additional features like seller rating or product category.

  Model Optimization:  Fine-tune hyperparameters to improve prediction accuracy.
    Here are some common hyperparameters which can be used:
    n_estimators: Number of trees in the random forest. Increasing the number of trees can improve model performance but might increase computation time.
    max_depth: Maximum depth of each tree in the forest. Deeper trees may capture more complex relationships in the data but can lead to overfitting if not controlled.
    min_samples_split: Minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. Adjusting this parameter helps control overfitting by requiring a minimum number of samples in each split.
    max_features: Number of features to consider when looking for the best split. Limiting the number of features can help prevent the model from being too complex and reduce overfitting.

  Deployment: Consider deployment strategies for real-time eBay transactions.
    Here are some deployment strategies which can be used
    Containerization with Docker: Package your machine learning model and its dependencies into Docker containers. This approach ensures consistency across different environments and simplifies deployment across 
    various platforms.
    Microservices Architecture: Decompose your application into smaller, independently deployable services. For example, separate services for model inference, data preprocessing, and API endpoints can enhance
    scalability and maintainability.
    Serverless Computing (e.g., AWS Lambda): Deploy your model as a serverless function that automatically scales with demand. Services like AWS Lambda can handle the execution of your model in response to eBay  
    transaction events, optimizing cost and scalability.
    Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment process. This includes automated testing, version control, and deployment to production environments, 
    ensuring rapid and reliable updates.

On Basis of the above content, I have designed a Python code which demonstrates a practical implementation of a machine learning model to 
predict delivery dates for items sold on eBay. 

I have mentioned the codes in the following files: ebay-delivery-date-prediction.py
                                                          dataset.csv

I have provided the explanation of the codes, how did i practically implement it, in a separate file named: Code Explanation
